<h2>Portfolio Project</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    This portfolio showcases my initial projects built during my studies at iO Academy.
    Link: <a>https://frankied96.github.io/Portfolio/</a>
</p>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HTML</strong>: The foundational structure of the projects, used to create the content elements.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS</strong>: Empowered the portfolio with styling, ensuring a responsive and visually engaging user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Played a pivotal role in making the portfolio dynamic. Specifically, I've implemented JavaScript to fetch JSON data for the projects. This approach ensures that updating project details or adding new ones is a breeze, enhancing the maintainability of the site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version Control:</h3>
<p>
    Throughout the development of the portfolio, I employed Git as a version control system. This ensured that every step of the project, from its inception to its current state, was tracked. It allowed for efficient management of code changes, easy collaboration (when necessary), and served as a backup.
</p>

<h3>Future Endeavors:</h3>
<p>
    I'm continuously seeking ways to enhance and optimize my portfolio. As I progress in my journey with iO Academy, I intend to introduce more advanced projects and features.
