                    <p>I'm a junior software developer at the beginning of their journey! 
                        I'm middway through an intensive software development bootcamp where I am gaining knowledge and 
                        experinece in a variety of software development principles and languages. whilst doing this I am also 
                        studying part-time for a BSc in CompSci (software).</br></br>After 8 years as an Apple technician, 
                        I moved into tech recruitment where I gained an insight into a different side of tech. This experience 
                        convinced me to speed up my jourmey into software development, so I decided to find myself a bootcamp so 
                        that I could gain some project experience.</br></br>I am looking for my first junior role to further 
                        develop my skills and expand on my knowledge of new technologies.</p>

                    <p>I'm a big tech lover, always interested in learning about the latest developments in technology. This 
                        started as ealy as I can remember due to being surrounded by enigneers in the family and having a keen interest in how things work.
                        Gaming is also a huge interest of mine and how I spend alot of my free time.</br>Music has always been 
                        a part of my life as I started learning instruments and dance at a young age. This was probably my first 
                        introduction to technology as I taught myself to record and produce my own music in my early teens. i was 
                        even lucky enough to do an internship at Apple Music as an assistant radio producer for 6 months at their 
                        studios in London. </p>
